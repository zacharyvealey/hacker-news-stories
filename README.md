# hacker-news-stories
A program to plot the highest-rated Hacker News stories.

This programs was motivated by Eric Matthes's "Python Crash Course" which was an extremely fun guide to programming in Python. The Python program uses Hacker News' API to track the top-30 news stories. Moreover, the program creates a .svg file that when opened in a browser plots the news stories ranked by number of comments (where a link to each story is found by clicking on the associated bar in the graph).

The .svg file included in the repository was made on 12/9/2018.
